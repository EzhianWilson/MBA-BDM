### **Introduction:**

As a Business Analyst, I have been tasked with planning the database structure for an online shopping domain. Online shopping has become a rapidly growing industry in recent years, with more and more people choosing to shop online for the convenience it offers. Therefore, it is essential to have a well-designed and efficient database structure to ensure that the online shopping experience is seamless for customers.

To begin with, I will identify the entities and attributes required for the database structure. This will include at least 10 significant entities that are critical for the online shopping domain. Once the entities and attributes have been identified, I will create an ER diagram that will visually represent the relationships between the different entities. Finally, the ER diagram will be converted into a table design that will serve as the foundation for the database structure of the online shopping domain.
